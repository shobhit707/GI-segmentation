# GI-Segmentation
## GI-tract segmentation is a Machine Learning Model that segments the MRI scanned image into different segments masks, namely, stomach, small bowel, large bowel.
### This model helps to identify position of organs using MRI scan which better helps the radiologists to target only cancer cells, with great accurracy, using X-ray therapy and reduces any damage done to nearby organs.  

## How to use?
### As of now, the MRI image path needs to be hardcoded in the script itself. Then use the model to output the segmented mask of each organ.

## Here are the few Images showcasing how the output might look.
